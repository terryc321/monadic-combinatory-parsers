 state =  [   VALS     EXPRESSION-stack ]
 vals are the SIX numbers in the countdown tv show
 if a value is picked , removed from VALS list and put onto EXPRESSION stack
 if no value is picked , one of four operators + - * / is picked and added to expression stack
 hopefully this covers all possible 

map-append.scm
this version just uses function next
 next simply picks one of the numbers from VALS and puts it onto expression stack 
 once size of search space gets too big , keeping all data in memory at one time causes machine
 to slow to  a crawl
 so we switched to depth first search 

recursive.scm
 depth first search ...
